    "Note: this is the 2017 version of this assignment.\n",

    "In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)\n",
    "* understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "* develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy\n",
    "* implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier\n",
    "* implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier\n",
    "* implement and apply a Softmax classifier\n",
    "* implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier\n",
    "* understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers\n",
    "* get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)"
